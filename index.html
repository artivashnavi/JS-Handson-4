Ques.11  Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by A[i]. 

She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D. 

You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
Ans. 
function Birthday_Game(arr,D ,M) {
 
let i = 0;

  let sum = arr[i];
  let count = 0;
  for(let j = 1; j < arr.length; j++)
  {
    sum += arr[j];
    
    if(sum > D)
    {
      sum -= arr[i];
      i++;
    }
    else if(j - i === M-1)
    {
      if(sum === D)
      count++;
      sum -= arr[i];
      i++;
    }
  }
 return count;
}
